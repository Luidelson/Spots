🖼️ **Spots – Share Your Adventures**

Spots is a web platform I built to make sharing your favorite places and moments as easy and beautiful as possible. The idea came from wanting a simple, visual way to post and discover inspiring locations—whether it’s a hidden café, a mountain view, or a city street you love.

This project let me dive deep into modern frontend development, API integration, and user experience design. It’s fast, responsive, and focused on real people sharing real stories.

🔧 **How It Works**

Spots is a single-page application built with vanilla JavaScript, modular CSS, and a RESTful API backend.

**🧠 Backend (API)**
- RESTful endpoints for:
  - User profile management (view, edit, avatar update)
  - Card management (add, like, delete, view)
- Handles authentication and data persistence (API provided by TripleTen)

**🎨 Frontend**
- Built with vanilla JS and BEM-based CSS for modular, maintainable styles
- Responsive design for seamless use on any device
- Dynamic DOM updates for cards, likes, and profile info
- Form validation and user feedback for a smooth experience

📈 **Where It Could Go**

Spots has plenty of room to grow! Here are some directions I’m considering:
- **User Comments:** Let users discuss and recommend spots
- **Map Integration:** Show locations on an interactive map
- **Photo Albums:** Group posts by trip or theme
- **Social Features:** Follow friends, like and share posts
- **Advanced Search:** Filter by tags, location, or popularity

🆕 **What’s Coming Next**
- Profile customization and themes
- Real-time notifications for likes and comments
- Progressive Web App (PWA) support for offline use
- Accessibility improvements for all users
- Performance optimizations for even faster load times

🏁 **Wrapping It Up**

Spots started as a way to make sharing and discovering amazing places effortless. It’s intuitive, visually engaging, and solves a real need for travelers, photographers, and anyone who loves to explore. Building it taught me a lot about scalable architecture, user-centric design, and the power of simple, focused features.
